‚úÖ **Policy-aligned**
‚úÖ **Highly usable by students, staff, admin**
‚úÖ **Backed by immutable pass log**

## üéÅ **Core Objects**

| Object                     | Description                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Pass                       | A digital ticket for hallway movement               |
| Pass State                 | OPEN or CLOSED                                      |
| Student Status             | OUT (hallway) or IN (location)                      |
| Leg ID                     | Numeric counter for movements inside a pass         |
| Pass Log                   | Immutable record of pass lifecycle + actions        |
| Transfer of Responsibility | Defines who is responsible for student              |
| Destination ID             | Destination for the pass (room or shared area)      |
| Room ID                    | Static identifier for rooms/locations               |
| Descriptor ID              | Human-friendly name for a location                  |
| Groups                     | Separate sheet of dynamic groups for students/staff |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Logic**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Default State**

* Student is in **scheduled class**
* Scheduled teacher is responsible
* No active pass ‚Üí no tracking

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Pass Initiation**

* Starts from scheduled class, *unless override* by teacher/admin/support
* Pass always starts as **OPEN**
* Student status becomes **OUT**
* MVP: **instant passes only** (future: support scheduled)

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Pass Lifecycle**

* Movement logged as **Legs** of Pass ID
* Each Leg ID increment = new log event
* Pass closes when:
  * Student returns to class
  * Period auto-close
  * Admin/teacher manual close
  * Emergency override

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Responsibility Chain**

* OUT ‚Üí no staff responsible (student self-responsible)
* IN ‚Üí staff/location assumes responsibility
* Restroom ‚Üí *always OUT* (no IN allowed, no location transfer)

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Emergency Handling**

* Emergency locks all new passes
* Freezes existing ones (emergency close)
* Surfaces students who are OUT and who is IN where

## üö¶ **Behavior & Rules**

| Scenario                     | Behavior                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Student goes to restroom     | Pass is OUT, no IN, must return to origin            |
| Teacher/admin initiates pass | Origin state becomes that staff, not scheduled class |
| Student requests pass        | Subject to teacher autonomy settings                 |
| Emergency lock               | Freezes pass activity system-wide                    |
| Period ends                  | Auto-close passes based on staff type               |
| Long duration (LD)           | Flag pass when OUT exceeds threshold (configurable)  |
| Multiple passes              | **IMPOSSIBLE** - only one pass per student at a time |
| Pass state changes           | Student cannot change destinations mid-pass          |

---

## üîÑ **Pass State Logic (CONFIRMED)**

**Default State:** Student in scheduled class ‚Üí Teacher responsible

**Pass Creation:** 
- Default: Scheduled class ‚Üí OUT to DestinationID (Leg 1)
- Override: Teacher/Admin/Support can initiate from their location

**Pass Flow:**
1. **OUT to Destination** (student responsible, destID staff notified)
2. **IN to Destination OR Scheduled Class**
   - If Scheduled Class ‚Üí Pass CLOSED
   - If Destination ‚Üí Pass remains OPEN, Leg increments
3. **Restroom Exception:** If destIN = Restroom ‚Üí only option is return to previous destIN
4. **No Mid-Pass Changes:** Student cannot change destinations while OUT

**Pass Closure:**
- Return to scheduled class
- Period auto-close (based on staff type)
- Manual close by staff
- Emergency close

---

## üîç **Responsibility Resolution**

| State         | Responsible                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OUT           | Student self-responsible                                                 |
| IN (location) | Staff or staff group owning the location                                 |
| Restroom      | Student remains self-responsible (OUT)                                   |
| Emergency     | Staff who pulls student into location marks responsibility via interface |

## üîë **Authentication**

* **Google OAuth**
* Single Sign On using Google Workspace accounts
* Determines role based on which sheet (Student, Teacher, Support, Admin) user appears in

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture (CONFIRMED)**

- **Caching:** PropertiesService for performance
- **Timezone:** US Eastern (EDT/EST)

### **Performance Strategy:**
- **Data Caching:** Student/Teacher/Support sheets cached, refreshed on triggers
- **Dashboard Refresh:** 3-minute intervals for teacher dashboards
- **API Optimization:** Batch operations, minimal sheet reads
- **Concurrent Users:** Optimized for 150 staff + 2,500 students (300-900 daily passes)

### **Error Handling:**

- üßπ Clear Pass Logs
- üìã System Status
- üíæ Backup Data
- üîÑ Reset System

### **Emergency Procedures:**
- **Trigger:** Admin UI button only
- **Behavior:** Freeze all pass creation, notify all staff + students with active passes
- **UI:** Show all OUT students to all teachers for emergency accountability

### **Period Management:**
- **Auto-Detection:** Current period based on bell schedule + system time
- **Auto-Close Logic:**
  - All OUT passes ‚Üí CLOSED
  - Teacher/Admin IN passes ‚Üí CLOSED
  - Support IN passes ‚Üí Based on periodOverride setting

---

## üì± **User Experience**

### **Mobile-First Design:**

- **Support/Admin:** Enhanced visibility based on role

### **Notification Preferences:**
- **All ON/All OFF** toggle per staff member
- **HTML Email** notifications for pass actions
- **Emergency Notifications** to all staff + active pass holders

---
